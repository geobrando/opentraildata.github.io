The Open Trail System Specification (OpenTrails) helps citizens get outdoors to enjoy them.\r\n\r\n## What is OpenTrails?\r\n\r\nThe Open Trail System Specification (OpenTrails) defines a simple, common format for public trails and associated geographic information. OpenTrails allows public land agencies to publish their trail data and developers to write applications that consume that data in an interoperable way. \r\n\r\n## How Do I Get Started?\r\n\r\n* [Preview the Spec](http://www.codeforamerica.org/specifications/trails/spec.html)\r\n* [Read the full working draft](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1KF8KAio-SqGHhh9oFY_KjfwIi3PePOHg7KfTSPh27fc/edit)\r\n* [Learn more about the OpenTrails System Specification](http://www.codeforamerica.org/specifications/trails)\r\n* [Watch the first OpenTrails Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wFB3GG02ks)\r\n* **[Enroll in the first OpenTrails Course!
